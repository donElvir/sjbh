      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Saint John the Baptist House was canonically erected in the Diocese of Tyler
        on the Feast of the Annunciation of Our Lady, March 25, 2023, as a religious house
        of the Missionaries of the Holy Cross, an Institute of Consecrated Life of
        Pontifical Right. The Institute was recognized by the Pontifical Commission
        <em>Ecclesia Dei</em> on the Feast of Saint John the Baptist, June 24, 2004.

      <h2>Religious Life and Prayer</h2>
      <p>
        The primary mission of our house is the faithful living of the religious life.
        We pray the Divine Office daily for the glory of God, the salvation of souls,
        the intentions of the Holy Church, and all those entrusted to our pastoral care.
      </p>

      <h2>Holy Mass and Parish Ministry</h2>
      <p>
        Holy Mass is offered every weekday at 6:30 a.m. and on Sundays at 2:00 p.m.
        at Saint Joseph the Worker Catholic Parish.
      </p>
      <p>
        At present, two of our priests assist at Saint Joseph the Worker Parish in Tyler
        by administering the Sacraments, offering spiritual direction, teaching Catechism,
        and providing particular care for solemn liturgical celebrations. These include
        Corpus Christi processions, Holy Week liturgies, and the Midnight Mass, which was
        celebrated last Christmas at the gymnasium of Bishop Gorman Catholic School due
        to the large number of faithful in attendance.
